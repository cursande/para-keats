# para-keats

This library will take a random stanza from a Keats poem and then replace the last word of each line with a rhyming word (or near-rhyme if necessary) found via the datamuse API.

Originally inspired by Carin's Meier's Twitter bot described [here](http://howistart.org/posts/clojure/1/index.html).
